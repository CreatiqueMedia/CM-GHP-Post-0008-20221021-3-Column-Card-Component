## My process

1. I create a project folder structure.
2. I then create a "Project" folder and an "Archive" folder.
3. I download the Frontend Mentor files to the "Archive" folder.
4. I unzip the folder, then I rename the folder to my blog post title and then I copy this folder to the "Project" folder.
5. I then rename the "images" folder to "assets".
6. I then create a "css" folder as a direct child of the project folder.
7. I then create a link to the stylesheet in the <head> of the "index.html" file.
8. I then start coding!
